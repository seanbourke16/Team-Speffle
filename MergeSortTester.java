  ALGORITHM:
  <INSERT YOUR DISTILLATION OF ALGO HERE>
  BIG-OH CLASSIFICATION OF ALGORITHM:
  My trio came up with a runtime of O(nlog(n)). We split the alogithm into 
two parts: the splitting up of the numbers and the merging of the numbers.
The first part of the algorithm is O(n). This is because it touches every 
element once before its done. The second part is O(nlog(n)) because it goes 
through every element multiple times but not quite n^2. This would make the 
total for the algoritm O(n+nlog(n)) but this is effectivly O(nlog(n)).
  Mean execution times for dataset of size n:
  Batch size: <# of times each dataset size was run>
  n=1       time: 
  n=10      time: 
  n=100     time: 
  ...
  n=<huge>  time:
